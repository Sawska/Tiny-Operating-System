# 🖥️ Tiny Operating System (Tiny-OS)

A minimal hobby operating system built **from scratch** — including a custom bootloader, kernel, basic task scheduling, and hardware interfacing — designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi Pico** or similar microcontroller.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Problem: To gain a deep understanding of low-level computer architecture and operating system fundamentals by building a functional core OS.

Solution: Developed a simple hobby operating system from scratch, including a custom bootloader, a basic kernel, and task scheduling. The project also aims to run this system on a minimal hardware platform, such as a microcontroller.

Result: A working, minimal operating system demonstrating core OS concepts and providing practical experience in hardware-level programming, memory management, and process control.

## 🚀 Core Concepts

* **Custom Bootloader** – Initializes hardware and loads the kernel into memory.
* **Minimal Kernel** – Provides task scheduling, memory management, and hardware abstraction.
* **Multitasking Scheduler** – Supports cooperative or preemptive task switching.
* **Hardware Interaction** – Low-level drivers for peripherals (UART, SPI, I²C, GPIO, PWM, etc.).
* **Microcontroller Target** – Built for ARM Cortex-M0+ (Raspberry Pi Pico).
